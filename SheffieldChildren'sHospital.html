<h1> Sheffield Children's Hospital Charity</h1>
<h2> About </h2>
<p> Donations are used to help improve the Children's hospital by buying life-saving equipment, funding critical research and creating a comfortable and friendly environment for the children.</p>
<h2> Research</h2>
<p> Charitable donations fund vital research not covered by the NHS - each year over £250,000 of research is carried out. A brand new clinical research facility will be opened in the near future, which is the first of its kind in the UK.</p>
<h2> Facilities </h2>
<p> Make it Better appeal is the biggest campaign to date and will see the hospital renovated with spacious wards and departments, with lots of private ensuite rooms allowing families to stay together. Also provides secure outdoor space for relaxation. </p>
<p> Room sponsorship is helpful for patients to provide an environment catered especially for them. Consultation rooms can be fitted with additions that go beyond basic NHS provisions such as enhanced parent facilities, lighting and equipment.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p> This charity makes play specialists jobs easier by funding craft materials, toys and games allowing children to play and participate in activities while at hospital. Each year £5000 needs to be raised to donate to the team to continue their amazing work.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p> Current equipment which is 10 years out of date, can be replaced with a brand new Multipurpose Fluroscopy System, enabling quick diagnosis and surgical intervention.</p>
