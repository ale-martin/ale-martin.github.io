<h1>Dig Deep</h1>


<h2>Who are they?</h2>

<p>Dig Deep works to provide schools and communities with access to water and sanitation in rural Kenya.</p>

<p>Work in partnership with communities to bring lasting change, building rainwater harvesting systems and latrines; working with communities to ensure that the water supplies are maintained for future generations; and training students, teachers and community leaders in hygiene and sanitation, enabling people to break the cycle of poverty and transform their own lives.</p>

<h2>What they do?</h2>

<p>Clean drinking water, proper toilets and good hygiene are essential, and yet in rural Kenya too many children and communities lack these services. They have to walk long distances to collect water; children are getting sick from unclean water and poor hygiene and girls are dropping out of school because of the difficulty of not having private toilets.</p>

<p>They also train teachers and community health workers in health and hygiene, ensuring that communities understand how diseases spread and what they need to do to keep themselves and their families healthy. We also run menstrual hygiene training, breaking down stigma, correcting misinformation and giving girls the tools and insight they need to continue their education and role in the community when menstruating.</p>

<p>They build latrines in schools, providing children with a safe, hygenic and private space in which to go to the toilet. While this sounds simple, it has a huge impact on childrenâ€™s health and school attendance, particularly for teenage girls.</p>
