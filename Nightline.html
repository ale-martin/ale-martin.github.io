<h2>Who do we help?</h2>

<p>For most students their time at university is a positive experience however for some it can be characterised by periods of stress, anxiety, loneliness and depression. Rising fees, academic pressures and concerns about employability can also impact on student mental wellbeing. Nightlines offer university students a safe space to talk about their feelings or whatever’s troubling them with fear of being judged or ridiculed.</p>
